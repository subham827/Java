Throwable class consists Exception and Error. Exception can be handled whereas error cannot be handled.
Exception are of two types- checked and unchecked.
Checked have again two classes- IOExceprtion,SQLException
Unchecked have Runtimexception and Runtimeexception has - Arithmetic exception and so on.
Unchecked exceptions are the exceptions in run time.
Checked exceptions are the compile time.
The finally block in java is used to put important codes such as clean up code.The finally block executes whether exception is rised or not and handled or not.
Now if the exception in try block is not handled , the program will be terminated and it will not execute any code written after the try statement,unless it is surrounded by finally block.
